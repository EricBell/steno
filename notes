 No API Keys Required! 🎉                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
  This application runs completely locally with zero API costs. Here's why:                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                     
  1. Whisper (Speech-to-Text):                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
  - ✅ Uses faster-whisper - an open-source local implementation
  - ✅ Downloads the model from HuggingFace (public, no key needed)                                                                                                                                                                                      
  - ✅ Runs entirely on your machine (CPU/GPU)                                                                                                                                                                                                           
  - ❌ NOT using OpenAI's paid Whisper API                                                                                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
  2. Ollama (AI Summarization):                                                                                                                                                                                                                          

  - ✅ Runs local LLM models on your machine
  - ✅ No internet connection needed after model download
  - ✅ Completely free and private

  3. No External API Calls:

  # The only thing that happens:
  1. Upload video to YOUR server (localhost:8000)
  2. Process on YOUR machine
  3. Return transcript to YOUR browser

  # No data leaves your computer!

  What Gets Downloaded (One-Time):

  - Whisper model (~150MB for base model) - downloaded automatically from HuggingFace
  - Ollama model (~4.7GB for llama3.1:8b) - only if you start Ollama service

  Privacy & Cost Benefits:

  ✅ Free - No API costs ever
  ✅ Private - Your videos never leave your machine
  ✅ Offline - Works without internet (after initial model download)
  ✅ No Rate Limits - Process unlimited videos

  This is one of the major advantages of using local models instead of cloud APIs! 🔒

  ```
  Loading ollama first time is slow
  ```
   Ollama can be slow locally because:                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                    
  1. Large model size - llama3.1:8b is ~4.7GB to download                                                                                                                           
  2. First-time pull - Has to download from Ollama's registry
  3. CPU performance - LLMs are heavy on CPU without GPU                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                    
  Quick fixes for local development:

  Option 1: Skip Ollama entirely (fastest)
  The app works fine without it - transcription doesn't need Ollama, only the optional AI summary does.

  # Edit docker-compose.yml to comment out ollama service
  docker-compose up whisper  # Only start whisper

  Option 2: Use a tiny model (much faster)
  Replace the model with a smaller one:

  # After ollama starts, pull a tiny model instead
  docker exec -it ollama ollama pull tinyllama  # Only ~600MB
  # or
  docker exec -it ollama ollama pull llama3.2:1b  # ~1.3GB

  Then update your code to use tinyllama or llama3.2:1b instead of llama3.1:8b.

  Option 3: Just wait it out once
  The model downloads once and is cached in the ollama-data volume. Subsequent starts are fast.

  My recommendation for local dev: Skip Ollama or use tinyllama. Save the big model for production on Dokploy.
